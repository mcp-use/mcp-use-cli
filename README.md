[mcp-use](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use).

```bash
npx mcp-use dev
npx mcp-use client connect demo https://example.com/mcp
npx mcp-use client demo tools list

`mcp-use dev` serves the MCP endpoint, watches views for HMR, and mounts the
Inspector. `--tunnel` exposes either `dev` or `start` through the managed
relay in [`@mcp-use/tunnel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mcp-use/tunnel).

Run `mcp-use --help` for the full option list.
